title: What type of relays are most needed?
---
description:

* The exit relay is the most needed relay type but it also comes with the highest legal exposure and risk (and **you should NOT run them from your home**).
* If you are looking to run a relay with minimal effort, fast guard relays are also very useful
* Followed by bridges.
