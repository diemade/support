title: Can I use IPv6 on my relay?
---
description:
Tor [has partial support for IPv6](https://blog.torproject.org/state-of-ipv6-support-tor-network) and we encourage every relay operator to [enable IPv6 functionality](https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/post-install/) in their [torrc](../../tbb/tbb-editing-torrc/) configuration files when IPv6 connectivity is available.
For the time being Tor will require IPv4 addresses on relays, you can not run a Tor relay on a host with IPv6 addresses only.
