title: Should I install Tor from my package manager, or build from source?
---
description:

If you're using Debian or Ubuntu especially, there are a number of benefits to installing Tor from the [Tor Project's repository](https://support.torproject.org/apt/tor-deb-repo/).

* Your `ulimit -n` gets set to 32768  high enough for Tor to keep open all the connections it needs.
* A user profile is created just for Tor, so Tor doesn't need to run as root.
* An init script is included so that Tor runs at boot.
* Tor runs with `--verify-config`, so that most problems with your config file get caught.
* Tor can bind to low level ports, then drop privileges.
