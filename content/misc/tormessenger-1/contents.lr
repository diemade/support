description:
No. After eleven beta releases, we discontinued support of [Tor Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/sunsetting-tor-messenger).
We still believe in Tor's ability to be used in a messaging app, but we don't have the resources to make it happen right now.
Do you? [Contact us](https://www.torproject.org/contact).
