description:
If you have exhausted general [troubleshooting](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/troubleshooting/) steps, it's possible that your connection to Tor is censored.
In that case, connecting with one of the [built-in censorship circumvention](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) methods in Tor Browser can help.
[Connection Assist](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/running-tor-browser/) can automatically choose one for you using your location.

If Connection Assist is unable to facilitate the connection to Tor, you can configure Tor Browser to use one of the built-in circumvention methods manually.
To use bridges and access other censorship circumvention related settings, click "Configure Connection" when starting Tor Browser for the first time.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
From the menu, select a [censorship circumvention method](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/).

Or, if you have Tor Browser running, click on "Settings" in the hamburger menu (â‰¡) and then on "Connection" in the sidebar.
In the "Bridges" section, locate the option "Choose from one of Tor Browser's built-in bridges" and click on the "Select a built-In bridge" option.
Select a censorship circumvention method from the menu.
Your settings will automatically be saved once you close the tab.

If Tor fails to connect, you might have to try other methods of getting bridges.
Please refer to the [Tor Browser User Manual](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges) for further instructions and more information about bridges.
If you have Tor Browser installed type `about:manual#bridges` in the address bar of Tor Browser to read the offline manual.
