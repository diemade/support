description:

Tor Browser in its default mode is starting with a content window rounded to a multiple of 200px x 100px to prevent fingerprinting of the screen dimensions.
This is an anti-fingerprinting feature in Tor Browser called [Letterboxing](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/#letterboxing).
